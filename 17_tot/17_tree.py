query = ("I have been working on a desktop app project for macOS for a few months now. "
"At this stage, I have approximately 2000 users of this app and I'm the only developer (can't change atm). "
"This success signals that I may need to invest more resources into this project. "
"Currently, I am the only developer of this app. Moreover, this is not my only project; "
"I have several others, which necessitates careful time management and focus. "
"I am faced with the decision of choosing between two paths: "

"The first is about implementing a redesign, which has already been completed. "
"The goal is to improve the overall brand and, specifically, the app's user experience. "
"I plan to fix UI bugs, enhance performance, and add the most-requested features. "
"This may attract more users to the app. "

"The second option is about extending the backend. "
"This will provide me with much more flexibility when implementing even the most advanced features requested by users, "
"although I cannot guarantee they will actually use them. "
"This path would require a larger time investment initially but would improve the development process in the future. "

"Note: "
"- I'm a full-stack designer and full-stack developer. I have broad experience in product development and all business areas. "
"- I'm a solo founder and I'm not looking for a co-founder or team "
"- I'm familiar with all the concepts and tools so feel free to use them "

"Help me decide which path to take by focusing solely on a business context.")
